<p class="center">(b. December 12, 1765)</p>


<p>Very little is known about the author of "The Politician Out-witted,"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
a play which I have selected as representative of the
efforts of the American drama, as early as 1789, to reflect the political
spirit of the time. Assiduous search on the part of the present
editor has failed to bring to light any information from any
of the historical societies regarding Mr. Low, except that he was
born on December 12, 1765, and that he must have been, in his
political sympathies, an anti-federalist. The reader who is interested
in literary comparisons might take this play of Low's and
read it in connection with Dunlap's "The Father," in which a
prologue gives a very excellent example of the American spirit.
Dunlap's "Darby's Return" might likewise be read in connection
with "The Politician Out-witted," inasmuch as it refers to the
Federal Constitution, and to Washington's inauguration.</p>

<p>The present play, which was opposed to the Federal union, was,
according to some authorities, offered to the actors, Hallam and
Henry, and was promptly rejected by them. There is no record
of the piece having thereafter succeeded in reaching the theatre.
It is mentioned both in Dunlap and in Seilhamer in a casual
manner.</p>

<p>In the New York Directory, of 1794, we find Samuel Low mentioned
as a clerk in the Treasury Department, and, in a later Directory
of 1797-1798, he is referred to as the first bookkeeper in
the Bank of New York.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span></p><p>In the preface to his published poems, after the diffident manner
of the time, Low says: "Many of the pieces were written at a
very early age, and most of them under singular disadvantages;
among which, application to public business, for many years past,
was not the least; not only because it allowed little leisure for
literary pursuits, but because it is of a nature peculiarly inimical
to the cultivation of poetic talent. For his own amusement and
improvement he has written&mdash;at the request of his friends he
publishes."</p>

<p>We know that he was a writer of odes, exhibiting some grace
in his handling of this poetic form. He is also credited with having
written a long poem entitled "Winter Displayed," in 1794.
In 1800, two volumes of poems appeared in New York, and
among the subscribers listed were John Jacob Astor, William
Dunlap, Philip Hone, Dr. Peter Irving, and members of the
Beekman and Schermerhorn families.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Examining the contents of
these volumes, one discovers that Samuel Low, in a social and fraternal
way, must have been a very active member of New York
society. On January 8, 1800, his "Ode on the Death of Washington"
was recited by Hodgkinson at the New York Theatre.</p>

<p>At St. Paul's Church, and at Trinity Church, his anthems and
odes were ever to the fore. He must have been a member of the
Tammany Society, or Columbian Order, because a "Hymn to
Liberty" was penned by him, and sung in church on the anniversary
of that organization, May 12, 1790.</p>

<p>His Masonic interests are indicated throughout the volume by
poems written especially for such orders as the Holland Lodge,
and the Washington Chapter of Royal Arch Masons. He was
also asked to write an epitaph on John Frederick Roorbach.</p>

<p>His interest in politics may likewise be seen in several poems
written about the Constitution of the United States; while his
literary taste may be measured by his tribute to Kotzebue, the
"second Shakespeare," in which occur the lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>The purest, sweetest among modern bards</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Who tread the difficult dramatic path.</i>"<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span></p>
<p>Except for this, as one of the biographical sources says, nothing
is known of Low's history, "and he is only saved from absolute
oblivion by his two small volumes of poems."</p>

<p>Yet "The Politician Out-witted" has historical value, and, in its
dialogue, exhibits how well Low had studied the artificial comedy
of Sheridan. The construction of the plot is mechanical, but the
convictions of the two opposing fathers, on the subject of the Constitution,
give the play an interest in character and in viewpoint
which is marked. It is not a piece adapted to the theatre, there
being slight action of a cumulative kind; but, as an example of
early closet drama, it cannot be ignored.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Through the assiduous researches of a member of the staff of the Americana
Division of the New York Public Library, who has generously given me permission
to use the results of this investigation, there is brought to light, in the New York
Directory for 1803, the name of Widow Ann Low, keeper of a boarding-house. There
is a plausible theory framed by this investigator that, maybe, Samuel Low died
during the New York yellow fever epidemic of 1803, although his name does not
occur in the New York <i>Evening Post</i> death lists for that year. It may be that our
Samuel, as revealed in the annals of the Dutch Reform Church, v. 1, p. 273; v. 32,
p. 23 (New York Geneological and Biographical Society), married Anne Creiger,
as recorded on April 20, 1797, and that she may be the "Widow Ann" referred to
above. The Nicholas Low mentioned in the Directories of the time as President of
the Bank of New York, and who was well-to-do, must have been the brother, or
some near relation. There are many Samuel Lows of this period; one (1739-1807)
mentioned in the D. A. R. Lineage, v. 15; another who married Margaret Kip.
The nearest we get to our Low's parentage is a reference, in the Reports of the New
York Geneological and Biographical Society, v. 29, p. 36, to John and Susanna
Low, whose son, Samuel, was, born December 22, 1765. Identification has yet to
be established.</p></div>

be at least ten years older than his wife.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> Ten years; fifty-three and ten are sixty-three.
Then you mean your wife shall be fifty-three years of age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> S'death, sir! I tell you I am but two and forty
years old: She sha'n't be more than thirty odd, sir, and she shall
be ten years younger than I am too.</p>

ha. The exiguity of those legs is a most promising earnest of
your future exploits, and demonstrate your agility, virility,

think what a blessed union there will be between August and
December; a jolly, buxom, wanton, wishful, plethoric female of
thirty odd, to an infirm, decrepit, consumptive, gouty, rheumatic,

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Young Loveyet</span>.</i></p>

<p>In compliance with the commands of a father, here I am,
once more in the place of my nativity. Duty to him, and curiosity
to know, why he has enjoined my sudden departure so peremptorily,
as well as a desire to see New-York (perhaps never to leave
it more) have all conspir'd to bring me here sooner than I am expected,&mdash;let
me see&mdash;yes, I must try to find out Frankton first.
[<i><span class="smcap">Humphry</span> crosses the stage.</i>] Here, friend, honest man, prithee
stop.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> What's your will?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Can you inform me, friend, where one Mr. Frankton
lives?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> No, I don't know where anybody lives in this big
city, not I; for my part, I believe how they all lives in the street,
there's such a monstrous sight of people a scrouging backards and
forards, as the old saying is. If I was home now&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Where is your home, if I may make so free?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Oh, you may make free and welcome, for the more
freer the more welcomer, as the old saying is; I never thinks myself
too good to discourse my superiors: There's some of our
townsfolks now, why some of 'um isn't so good as I, to be sure.
There's Tom Forge, the blacksmith, and little Daniel Snip, the
tailor, and Roger Peg, the cobbler, and Tim Frize, the barber, and
Landlord Tipple, that keeps the ale-house at the sign of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>

why, there an't one of 'um that's a single copper before a beggar,
as the old saying is; but what o' that? We isn't all born alike, as
father says; for my part, I likes to be friendly, so give us your
hand. You mus'n't think how I casts any reflections on you;
no, no, I scorn the action. [<i>They shake hands.</i>] That's hearty
now&mdash;Friendship is a fine thing, and, a friend indeed is a friend

of my arrival; for I wish to try if he would know me;&mdash;and yet
I long to embrace my aged and venerable parent.&mdash;Will you do
me the favour to take this letter to my father, Mr. Cubb? He

three-story red brick house.&mdash;I'll reward you for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> As for your rewards, I'm above it, d' ye see: If I

my old sweetheart; I an't so poor, but what I can buy her a ribbon

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Pray, Maria, how were you entertained at the
Assembly last night?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> Very indifferently, I assure you, my dear: You know,
Harriet, I do most cordially hate dancing at any time; but
what must one do with one's self these irksome, heavy, dreary
Winters? If it were not for cards, visits to and from, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Assemblies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> Yes, as my last resource, Assemblies, I should absolutely
be in a state of despair before Spring.&mdash;Then one may take
an excursion on York or Long-Island&mdash;an agreeable sail on the
East-River&mdash;a walk in the Broadway, Pharisee-like, to be seen of
men, and&mdash;to see them&mdash;and then how refreshing to take a negligent
stroll on the Battery, the Fort, the Mall, and from thence to
Miss Such-a-one, then to Mrs. Such-a-one, then to Lady What's-her-name,
and then home;&mdash;but now I am half of my time as
motionless as Pitt's statue; as petrified and inanimate as an
Egyptian mummy, or rather frozen snake, who crawls out of his
hole now and then in this season to bask in the rays of the sun.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> And whenever the sunshine of Mr. Frankton's
eyes breaks upon you, you revive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> Pshaw&mdash;I wish you had Mr. Frankton yourself, since
you are so full of his sweet image.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> I'm sure you did not wish so last night: Your eyes
seem'd to say,&mdash;I wish I could secure the good-for-nothing, agreeable
rake.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> Oh, you <i>heard</i> my <i>eyes</i> say so, did you? I ask pardon
of your penetration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> But do you really think the Winter is so destitute of
comforts?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> Ha, ha, comforts! by comforts I suppose you mean
the sweets of domestic life&mdash;the large portion of comfort arising
from a large winter fire, and the very pleasing tittle-tattle of an
antiquated maiden aunt, or the equally pleasing (tho' less loquacious)
society of a husband, who, with a complaisance peculiar to
husbands, responds&mdash;sometimes by a doubtful shrug, sometimes
a stupid yawn, a lazy stretch, an unthinking stare, a clownish
nod, a surly no, or interrogates you with a&mdash;humph? till bed
time, when, heaven defend us! you are doom'd to be snor'd out
of your wits till day-break, when&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Hold, Maria&mdash;what a catalogue of uncomfortable
comforts have you run over.&mdash;Pleasure and Comfort are words
which imply the same thing with me; but in this enlighten'd age,
when words are so curiously refin'd and defin'd, modern critics
and fashionable word-mongers have, in the abundance of their
wisdom, made a very nice distinction between them&mdash;for my part,
I always endeavour to reconcile modish pleasure with real comfort,
and custom with reason, as much as is in any way consistent
with the obligation one is under to conform a little to the perverse
notions of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> There now!&mdash;you know I can't abide to hear you
moralize&mdash;prithee, my dear Harriet, leave that to grey beards
and long-ear'd caps&mdash;everything is beautiful in its season, you
know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Common sense and propriety are ever in season,
Maria, and I was going to mention a <i>sentimental</i> pleasure, a
<i>rational</i> enjoyment, which is peculiar to the present <i>season</i>, tho'
beautiful in every one, if you had not got frightened at the idea
of being <i>comforted</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> Well, my dear comfortable, rational, sentimental
Harriet! Let me hear what this rational enjoyment of yours is?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Hearing a good play, my dear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> Hearing a good play! why not seeing it, pray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Because I believe plays are frequently seen, and
not heard; at least, not as they ought to be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> I protest you are quite a critic, Harriet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> If you desire amusement, what so likely to beguile
the heavy hours as Comedy? If your spirits are depress'd, what
so replete with that which can revive them as the laughter-loving
Thalia? If the foibles and vices of human nature ought to suffer
correction, in what way can they be satiriz'd so happily and suc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>cessfully
as on the stage;&mdash;or if elegance of language, and refinement
of sentiment&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> Humph&mdash;there's sentiment again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> You dislike every good thing I have mentioned this
morning, Maria,&mdash;except one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> What's that, my dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Mr. Frankton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> Ha, ha. Why, to be sure, the good things of this life
are not to be despis'd, and men are not the worst creatures belonging
to this life, nor Mr. Frankton the worst of men, but&mdash;apropos,
about plays&mdash;did you observe how much I was affected
the other night at the tragedy of Zara?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> I really did not&mdash;I wish I had seen such a pleasing
proof of your sensibility.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> Oh, you cruel creature!&mdash;wish to see your friend in
tears?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> 'Tis rather unusual to see a lady of your taste and
spirit, either weep at a pathetic incident in tragedy, or laugh at a
comic scene; and as for the gentlemen, your lads of spirit, such
as are falsely called <i>ladies' men</i>, they are not so masculine as to
understand, and, therefore, not so effeminate as to weep; tho'
one would conclude, from their effeminacy in appearance and behaviour,
that they would cry if you were to look at them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> To be sure, a little matter will draw tears from the
feminine part of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> For your part, you seem'd to be neither laughing
nor crying, but rather displeas'd and uneasy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> Oh, you mistake the matter entirely, my dear; your
skill in physiognomy is but indifferent, I find&mdash;why, after the
tragedy was over, I laugh'd most inordinately for a considerable
time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> On what account, pray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> Why, you must know, my dear, Mr. Frankton sat
in the box opposite to the one I was in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Yes, I know your dear Mr. Frankton was in the
opposite box.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> My dear Mr. Frankton! Did I say so? Why I
could not say more of him, were he my husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> If you conform to custom, you would not say so
much of a husband.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> But I did not say any such thing. Says I, you must
know, my dear Harriet&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> No, no, there was no Harriet mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> But I say there was&mdash;so, as I was going to tell you,
you must know, my dear Harriet, that Mr. Frankton sat
opposite to me at the theatre; and as he seem'd to be very much
chagrin'd at the attention which was paid me by a couple of
beaux, I took some pains to mortify him a little; for, tho'
he strove to hide his uneasiness by chattering, and whispering,
and tittering, and shewing his white teeth, his embarrassment
was very visible under his affected unconcern.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> How exactly she has described her own situation and
feelings! [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;I find that you acquire <i>your skill in physiognomy</i>
from sympathy; or from making suitable comparisons, and
drawing natural inferences from them; but now for the remainder
of your pleasant anecdote, Maria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> So, I was extremely civil to my two worshipping votaries,
grinn'd when they did, and talk'd as much nonsense as
either of them. During this scene of mock-gallantry, one of my
love-sick swains elevated his eyes in a most languishing manner;
and, clasping his sweet, unlucky hands together rather eagerly,
my little dog Muff happen'd to be in the way, by which means
my pet was squeez'd rather more than it lik'd, and my Adonis's
finger bit by it so feelingly, that it would have delighted you to
see how he twisted his soft features about, with the excruciating
anguish. Ha, ha, ha.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Ha, ha, ha. Exceeding ludicrous indeed!&mdash;But
pray, my dear careless, sprightly Maria, was you not a little
nettled to see Mr. Frankton and his nymphs so great? And are
you not deeply in love with each other, notwithstanding your
coquetry at the theatre, and his levity at the Assembly?&mdash;Yes,
yes,&mdash;your aversion to the dancing last night was only pretence.
I hope when your hearts are cemented by wedlock, you will both
do better.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> It will be well if I do no worse; but, to hear you talk,
one would swear you were not in love yourself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Love is an amiable weakness, of which our sex are
peculiarly susceptible.</p>

<p class="befstagedir"><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> Ha, ha, ha; <i>of which our sex are peculiarly susceptible</i>&mdash;what
an evasion!&mdash;and so my dear lovelorn, pensive, sentimental,
romantic Harriet has never experienced that same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span>
<i>amiable weakness</i> which, it seems, the weaker sex is so susceptible
of. But I won't tease you about Mr. Loveyet any more; adieu.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Going.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Ha, ha; why in such sudden haste, my dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> When did you say you saw her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> Last night, in company with several other belles
of no small note, who did not look a tittle the handsomer for
appearing at the same time with her, I assure you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Then she's as charming as ever.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> Charming as ever! By all that's beautiful, a
Seraphim is nothing to her! And as for Cherubims, when they
compete with her,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> You extol her in very rapturous strains, George&mdash;I
hope you have not been smitten by her vast perfections, like
the Cherubims.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> I am really enraptur'd with the bewitching little
Goddess!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Do you positively think her so much superior to the
generality of women?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> Most indubitably I do&mdash;don't you, pray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I thought her handsome once&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;but you
certainly are not in love with her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> Not I, faith. Ha, ha, ha. My enamorata and
yours are two distinct persons, I assure you&mdash;and two such beau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>ties!&mdash;By
all that's desirable, if there was only one more in the
city who could vie with the lovely girls, and boast of the same
elegantly proportioned forms; the same beauty, delicacy and
symmetry of features; the same celestial complexion, in which
the lily and carnation are equally excell'd; the same&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Oh, monstrous! Why, they exceed all the Goddesses
I ever heard of, by your account.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> Well, if you had let me proceed, I should have told
you that if one more like them could be found in town, they would
make a more beautiful triple than the three renowned goddesses
who were candidates for beauty and a golden apple long ago; but
no matter now.&mdash;The account you have given of the lovely
Harriet, has rekindled the flame she so early inspir'd me with,
and I already feel myself all the lover; how then shall I feel, when
I once more behold the dear maid, like the mother of mankind&mdash;"with
grace in all her steps, heaven in her eye; in every gesture,
dignity and love!"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> Aye&mdash;and what do you think of your father's
sending for you to marry you to this same beautiful piece of
mortality?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Is it possible? Then I am happy indeed! But this
surpasses my most sanguine hopes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> Did you suppose he would object to the alliance
then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I did not know,&mdash;my hope was only founded on
the <i>probability</i> of his approving it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> Well, I can now inform you that your hope has a
better basis to rest on, and that there is as fair a prospect of its
being shortly swallowed up in fruition as ever Cupid and Hymen
presented to a happy mortal's view.&mdash;For your farther comfort,
I have the pleasure to acquaint you, that Mr. Trueman is
equally fond of the match.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Better and better&mdash;my dear George! You are the
best of friends,&mdash;my happy genius! My very guardian angel!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> Well said, Heroics&mdash;come, spout away.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Yes, I <i>am</i> happy, very happy, indeed: Moralists
disparage this world too much,&mdash;there <i>is</i> such a thing as happiness
under the sun,&mdash;I <i>feel</i> it now most irrefragably,&mdash;<i>here</i> it
vibrates in a most extatic manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> Why, you are positively the arrantest love-sick
swain that ever had recourse to a philter.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Profane heretic in love! Did not you extol the two
Seraphims just now in the same generous language? But you
have never experienced the blissful transition from doubt and
solicitude to certainty and peace, as I do now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> How do you know that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I only conjecture so&mdash;Did you ever feel the same
transports I do?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> How, in the name of sense, should I know how you
feel?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Feel!&mdash;I feel that kind heaven, my friend, my
father, and my dearest girl, all conspire to bless me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> There he rides his hobby-horse again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Aye, and a generous horse he is&mdash;he carries me very
pleasantly, I assure you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> Yes, and, I dare say, could convey you more
agreeably and speedily to Paradise than the Ass did Mahomet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Ha, ha. I think you have improved my idea.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> To improve your reason, and check your strange
delirium, I have.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I will talk more dispassionately;&mdash;but my heart
<i>will</i> palpitate at the thought of meeting the lovely source of its
joy, and the ultimatum of all its wishes!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> I suppose you know she lives with Mr. Friendly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> With Mr. Friendly!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> Yes, she is nearly related to his family, and as the
style in which they live, corresponds with her former prosperity
better than the present ineligible situation of her father does, he
has granted them her valuable company, after their repeated solicitations
had prov'd the sincerity of their regard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> But how do you account for Mr. Trueman's poverty,
since fortune has lately put it so much in Harriet's power
to relieve him from it? I dare not think it arises from her want
of filial regard; I do not know anything so likely to abate the
ardour of my attachment as a knowledge of that; but it is an
ungenerous suggestion, unworthy the benignity and tenderness
of the gentle Harriet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> It is so.&mdash;Two things, on the part of the old gentleman,
are the cause: his pride will not suffer him to be the subject
of a daughter's bounty; and his regard for that daughter's
welfare, makes him fearful of being instrumental in impairing her
fortune.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I thought the angelic girl could not be ungrateful
to the parent of her being; but don't let us tarry&mdash;I am already
on the wing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> You are too sanguine; you must not expect to
succeed without a little opposition.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> How! what say you? pray be explicit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> I will remove your suspense.&mdash;There is a Mr.
Worthnought, a thing by some people call'd a man, a beau,
a fine gentleman, a smart fellow; and by others a coxcomb,
a puppy, a baboon and an ass.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> And what of him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> Nothing; only he visits Miss Harriet frequently.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Hah!&mdash;and does she countenance his addresses?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> I'll explain.&mdash;He imagines she is fond of him,
because she does not actually discard him; upon which presumption
he titters, capers, vows, bows, talks scraps of French, and
sings an amorous lay&mdash;with such an irresistibly languishing air,
that she cannot do less than compliment him&mdash;on the fineness of
his voice, for instance; the smartness of his repartees, the brilliancy
of his wit, the gaiety and vivacity of his temper, his genteel
carriage, his handsome person, his winning address, his&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Hah! you surely cannot be in earnest, Frankton.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> To be serious then,&mdash;the sum total of the affair,
I take to be this.&mdash;In order to kill a heavy hour, she sometimes
suffers the fool to be in her company, because the extravagance
of his behaviour, and the emptiness of his upper region furnish
her with a good subject for ridicule; but <i>your</i> presence will soon
make him dwindle into his primitive insignificance.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> If your prediction proves false, Harriet will be
false indeed;&mdash;but I must see her straightway.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frankton.</span> I think you go pretty well fraught with the fruits
of our united deliberations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Deliberations!&mdash;away with the musty term&mdash;</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Old Loveyet</span> and <span class="smcap">Trueman</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I tell you it is the most infernal scheme that ever
was devis'd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> And I tell you, sir, that your argument is heterodox,
sophistical, and most preposterously illogical.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I insist upon it, sir, you know nothing at all about
the matter; and, give me leave to tell you, sir&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> What&mdash;give you leave to tell me I know nothing at
all about the matter! I shall do no such thing, sir&mdash;I'm not to
be govern'd by your <i>ipse dixit</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I desire none of your musty Latin, sir, for I don't
understand it, not I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> Oh, the ignorance of the age! To oppose a plan
of government like the new Constitution. Like it, did I say?&mdash;There
never was one like it:&mdash;neither Minos, Solon, Lycurgus
nor Romulus, ever fabricated so wise a system;&mdash;why it is a
political phenomenon, a prodigy of legislative wisdom, the
fame of which will soon extend almost <i>ultramundane</i>, and astonish
the nations of the world with its transcendent excellence.&mdash;To
what a sublime height will the superb edifice attain!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Your aspiring edifice shall never be erected in <i>this</i>
State, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> Mr. Loveyet, you will not listen to reason: only
attend calmly one moment&mdash;[<i>Reads.</i>]&mdash;"We the people of the
United States, in order to form a more perfect union, establish
justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I tell you I won't hear it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> Mark all that. [<i>Reads again.</i>] "Section the first.&mdash;All
legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a
Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate
and House of Representatives." Very judicious and salutary,
upon my erudition.&mdash;"Section the second&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I'll hear no more of your sections.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> "Section the second.&mdash;The House of Representatives&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> They never shall represent me, I promise them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> Why, you won't hear me out.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I have heard enough to set me against it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> You have not heard a <i>quantum sufficit</i> to render
you competent to give a decisive opinion; besides, you hear with
passion and prejudice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I don't care for that; I say it is a devilish design
upon our liberty and property; by my body, it is;&mdash;it would reduce
us to poverty and slavery.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Humphry</span>, listening.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> What's that about liberty, and property, and slavery,
and popery, and the devil? I hope the pope and the devil
an't come to town for to play the devil, and make nigers of us!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> You will have it your own way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> To be sure I will&mdash;in short, sir, the old Constitution
is good enough for me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> I wonder what Constitution magnifies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> The old Constitution!&mdash;ha, ha, ha, ha. Superlatively
ludicrous and facetious, upon my erudition; and highly
productive of risibility&mdash;ha, ha, ha. The old Constitution!
A very shadow of a government&mdash;a perfect <i>caput mortuum</i>;&mdash;why,
one of my schoolboys would make a better: 'tis grown as
superannuated, embecilitated, valetudinarianated, invalidated,
enervated and dislocated as an old man of sixty odd.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Ah, that's me&mdash;that's me&mdash;sixty odd, eigh&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
I&mdash;I&mdash;ugh, ugh, I know what you want:&mdash;a consolidation
and annihilation of the States.</p>

<p class="befstagedir"><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> A consolidation and annihilation!&mdash;You certainly
have bid defiance to the first rudiments of grammar, and sworn
war against the whole body of lexicographers. Mercy on me!
If words are to be thus abus'd and perverted, there is an end of
the four grand divisions of grammar at once: If consolidation and
annihilation are to be us'd synonymously, there is a total annihilation
of all the moods, tenses, genders, persons, nouns, pronouns,
verbs, adverbs, substantives, conjunctions, interjections, prepositions,
participles,&mdash;</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Coughs.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Oh dear, oh dear,&mdash;what a wise man a Schoolmaster
is!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> How can the States be consolidated and annihilated
too? If they are consolidated or compounded into one
national mass, surely the individual States cannot be annihilated,
for, if they were annihilated, where would be the States to compose
a consolidation?&mdash;Did you ever study Logic, sir?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> No, but I've studied common sense tho', and that
tells me I am right, and consequently you are wrong; there,
that's as good logic as yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> You mean Paine's <i>Common Sense</i>, I suppose&mdash;yes,
yes, there you manifest something like common sense, Mr.
Loveyet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> 'Tis no such thing, sir; it lately took three speakers,
and much better ones than Paine, no less than three whole days,
to prove that consolidation and annihilation are one and the
same thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> An execrable Triumvirate&mdash;a <i>scandalum magnatum</i>
to all public bodies: I suppose they and their adherents are now
sitting in Pandemonium, excogitating their diabolical machinations
against us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> A pack of nonsensical stuff!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> Harkee, Mr. Loveyet, I will propound a problem
to you. We will suppose there are two parallel lines drawn on
this floor, which, notwithstanding they may be very contiguous
to each other, and advance <i>ad infinitum</i>, can never approximate
so near as to effect a junction, in which fundamental axiom all
mathematicians profess a perfect congruity and acquiescence:&mdash;now,
to elucidate the hypothesis a little, we will suppose here is
one line; and we will further suppose here is another line. [<i>Draws
his cane over <span class="smcap">Loveyet's</span> feet, which makes him jump.</i>] Now we
will suppose that line is you, and this line is compos'd, form'd,
constituted, made up of discernment, political knowledge, public
spirit, and true republicanism,&mdash;but, as I predicated antecedently,
<i>that</i> line is you&mdash;[<i>Striking his cane on <span class="smcap">Loveyet's</span> feet.</i>]
You must not forget <i>that</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> S'death, sir, do you mean to make a mathematical
instrument of me, to try experiments with?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> Now take notice&mdash;as the East is to the West, the
North Pole to the South ditto, the Georgium Sidus to this
terraqueous globe, or the Aborigines of America to the Columbians
of this generation, so is that line to this line, or Mr. Loveyet
to true wisdom and judgment; sometimes appearing to
verge towards a coalition with them, but never to effect it. There,
sir,&mdash;in this argument, you have a major, a minor and a conclusion,
consonant to the received principles of logic.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Confound your senseless comparisons; your problems,
your mathematics, and your Georgium Sidus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Aye, confound your gorgon hydras, I say too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Here you have been spending your breath to prove&mdash;what?&mdash;that
I am not a rational human being, but a mathematical
line.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> I know you are not a mathematical line; you are
not the twentieth part so straight and well made;&mdash;I only wish
to convince you that the present government is an <i>ignis fatuus</i>
that is leading you and thousands more to ruin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> But I don't choose to be convinc'd by you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> No more than you'll be convinc'd you are sixty
years old, I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Now see there again, see there! isn't this enough
to try Job's patience? I'll let you know that my bodily and
political Constitutions are both good, sir, both sound alike.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> I know they are. Ha, ha, ha.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Pray, old gentleman, what sort of things may them
same constitutions be?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> Avaunt, thou plebeian, thou ignoramus!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Why, I lay now I can say that as good as you, for
all you're such a fine scholard.&mdash;I won't be plain, thou ignorant
mouse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> "<i>Monstrum horrendum, cui lumen ademptum!</i>"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Monstrous memorandums, cu&mdash;no, I can't say
that; that's too hard for me. Well, what a glorious thing it is for
to have good larning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Sixty odd years indeed! provoking wretch!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> What a bloody passion he's in!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> Pray, Mr. Loveyet, do not anathematize me so;&mdash;if
you do not civilize your phraseology a little, I must have
recourse to a little castigation, for, <i>necessitas non habet legem</i>, you
know, Mr. Loveyet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I know nothing about such nonsense, not I.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Because he said you was his father&mdash;that's a good

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> How can that be, when the letter is dated in the
Island of Cuba, the twentieth day of January, and he says he
don't expect to leave it till the beginning of March, and this is
only February, so it is impossible he shou'd be here yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> May be you an't the old gentleman, then.</p>

d' ye see; but, for my part, I think how you look old enough and
ugly enough to be his great-grandfather, as the old saying is.</p>

for you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> I'm a going&mdash;howsomever, give me the letter

wou'dn't deny it.</p>

five and twenty per cent. more than any other merchant in the

evil, 'tis well enough for those to say so, who have none; for my

than not enough&mdash;that a man can live longer upon a hundred
thousand pounds than one thousand pounds&mdash;that if, the more
we have the more we want, the more we have the more we make&mdash;and
that it is better to make hay while the sun shines <i>against</i> a

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> <i>Improper subject</i>,&mdash;ha, ha, ha. So my very discreet,
prudish little Harriet never lets man enter into her head; tho'
it is pretty notorious somebody has enter'd into her heart long ago.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Your discernment must be very subtle, if you know
all that is in my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> I only judge of your heart, by your tongue; and the
abundance of the former is generally inferred from the speech of
the latter.&mdash;Yes, yes&mdash;that constant, hypocritical heart of yours
is now throbbing with love, hope, curiosity, and&mdash;a thousand
speechless sensations, the improper subject of which, I do not
hesitate to declare, is odious man; and that man, the accomplished
Mr. Loveyet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Pshaw,&mdash;how can you tantalize one so?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[Pg 388]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> Well, well, it shall not be serv'd like Tantalus any
more: <i>he</i> was doom'd to behold; and, beholding, to wish and
languish for the tempting draught, in vain: but a better doom
awaits the happy Harriet;&mdash;what she desires is not thus interdicted,
but will soon be obtain'd, and&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> How strangely you talk, Maria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> Well, I will not keep you in suspense any longer. Old
Mr. Loveyet has received a letter from his son, signifying his intention
to leave the West-Indies shortly after its date, so you may
expect to see him very soon. Then hey for a wedding, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Ha, ha; you are a droll girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> But my time is precious; I am just going to the widow
Affable's:&mdash;about twelve months ago she paid me a visit, when,
agreeably to the form in such cases made and provided, she beg'd
I would be more sociable, and she would take it so kindly of me:&mdash;accordingly
I shall step in <i>en passant</i>, to shew her my sociability
and kindness, which I shall, perhaps, repeat at the end of
another year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> How can you be so cruel? The pleasure I experience
in your society, makes me regret that any one should be deprived
of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Maria.</span> That is very strange:&mdash;I should imagine, if you priz'd
my company so much, you would wish me to withhold it from
others; because, the more I bless them with my presence, the
less will come to your share, you know, my dear;&mdash;nor is it easy
to conceive how you could be so fond of my sweet person, without
being jealous at the partiality of others;&mdash;but, after all, good people,
they say, are scarce; and my humble admirers shall find the
saying verified in me; because they are not fully sensible of my
superior value; but, since you prove the contrary, by extolling
my conversation and friendship so much, I likewise shall observe
a contrary conduct, and indulge you with a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i> frequently,
my dear.&mdash;But I have fifty places to call at yet:&mdash;I am to wait on
Miss Nancy Startup, Miss Biddy Dresswise, Miss Gaudy, Miss
Titterwell, Mrs. Furbelow, Mrs. Neverhome, Mrs&mdash;<i>et c&aelig;tera,
et c&aelig;tera</i>; which visits I mean to pay with all the formality and
fashionable shortness in my power: from thence I shall proceed
to Mademoiselle Mincit, the milliner; from thence to two or
three score of shops in William-Street, to buy a prodigious number
of important&mdash;</p>

of those officious "Nothing else, Ma'ms?" for all the goods from
the North Church to Maiden-Lane.&mdash;Adieu,&mdash;I leave you to
meditate on what I have told you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Farewell. [<i>Exit <span class="smcap">Maria</span>.</i>] Now Maria is gone, I
will see no more company.&mdash;If anything can be an excuse for a
falsehood, the present occasion offers a very good one:&mdash;I feel my

by the impertinence of pretended friends.&mdash;Who is there?</p>

insufferably vain and impudent freedoms with your name, that I
attempted to give him a little wholesome admonition with this, if

grant your valuable company to such superficial gentry, they will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[Pg 393]</a></span>
ever prove themselves as unworthy of it as he has; but your
goodness does not let you suspect the use which such characters
make of the intimacy they are honour'd with, or you would spurn
their unmeaning flattery, and ridiculous fopperies, with indignation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> I ever till now consider'd him as a respectful, well-meaning
person, as far as regarded myself; and as such, gave him
a prudent share of my civilities; but I never thought either his
intellects or his person sufficient to entitle him to a partial intimacy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> You cannot deny, madam, that I have repeatedly

what?&mdash;Your ideas are too mean and frothy to let you admire
anything but my dress, or some other trifle as empty and superficial

you was nothing but the effect of cheerfulness and politeness;
qualities which, I believe, are inherent in me, and of which,
therefore, all with whom I am acquainted are the objects; but
your present unmanly and insupportably impudent discourse,
makes me despise myself almost as much as you, for allowing such

<p class="befstagedir"><span class="smcap">Old Loveyet.</span> Look how they whisper!&mdash;well, she is the most

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> I think our troubles increase fast: how unlucky,
that this dispute should happen at the very crisis of your arrival;&mdash;an
event which we fondly expected would be attended with the
most pleasing circumstances.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Those fond expectations, my lovely partner in trouble,

of old age.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> You must take care not to talk of <i>age</i>, before him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Yes, my fair monitor; I shall think of that: and
now permit me, in my turn, to give you a little advice.&mdash;In the
first place, I would have you go to your father&mdash;fall at his feet&mdash;clasp
your fair hands, thus&mdash;beseeching him in such terms as that
gentle heart is so well form'd to dictate, and persuading him with
the all-prevailing music of that tuneful voice, to recall his
rigourous intention, nor doom such angelic goodness and beauty
to despair, by persisting to oppose an alliance which alone can
make you blest; and without which, the most faithful of lovers
will be rendered the most wretched one on earth. I shall take a
similar method with my old gentleman, and I think I can insure
myself success.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> This is all very fine; but&mdash;to have the voluntary
consent of the parent one loves,&mdash;how infinitely more agreeable!
I would not offend mine, for the world: and yet&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> And yet you will be obliged to offend him, by having
me, eigh?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Pshaw;&mdash;how strangely you misconstrue my meaning:
I was going to observe, that I expect his obstinacy and pride
will prove invincible, in spite of all the rhetoric you are pleased to
ascribe to me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[Pg 397]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Then we will employ a little rhetoric, against which
another class of fathers are not quite so invincible.&mdash;Parsons are
plenty, you know; and Gold and Silver are persuasive little
words. <i>Love</i> inspires me with the spirit of prophecy, and tells me
I shall soon with propriety call the loveliest of her sex, mine.</p>

to struggle for that liberty, independence and happiness, which
the new government will now render secure. <i>Item.</i> The Americans
were prodigious fortunate to obtain the said liberty, independence

your worshipful reverence, Mr. Schoolmaster, what's
Latin for Constitution?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> To tell you what is Latin for Constitution, will not
make you a particle the wiser; I will, therefore, explain it in the
vernacular tongue.&mdash;Constitution then, in its primary, abstract,
and true signification, is a concatenation or coacervation of simple,
distinct parts, of various qualities or properties, united, compounded,
or constituted in such a manner, as to form or compose
a system or body, when viewed in its aggregate or general nature.
In its common, or generally received, acceptation, it implies two
things.&mdash;First, the nature, habit, disposition, organization or
construction of the natural, corporeal, or animal system.&mdash;Secondly,
a political system, or plan of government. This last definition,
I apprehend, explains the Constitution you mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Like enough, but I don't understand a single word
you've been a talking about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> No! 'Tis not my fault then:&mdash;If plainness of language,
clearness of description, and a grammatical arrangement
of words will not suffice, I can do no more.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Old Loveyet</span> listening.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> I mean the Constitution that you read in the newspapers
about; that that your worship was a going to get at loggerheads
with old Mr. What's-his-name, about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I'll old you, you rascal!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> Did you never hear your friends in the country
talk of the new Constitution?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Not I, I never heard anybody talk about it, at the
Pharisee's Head;&mdash;I don't believe Jeremy Stave, the clark of the
meeting-house, no, nor Parson Thumpum himself ever heard of
such a word&mdash;No, not even old Mr. Scourge, the Schoolmaster.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> A hopeful genius, for a Schoolmaster, upon my education.
Do you send him to me,&mdash;I'll qualify him for that important
station.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> And I'll be qualify'd I never larnt such a word
when I went to his school.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> Nor any other one, I believe, properly speaking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Oh yes, I'll say that for him;&mdash;he us'd to take a

epistle?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Why, mounsieur, the barber.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> By the dignity of my profession, it must be so:&mdash;Now
there's a solution to the enigma.&mdash;Mr. Loveyet, you will
excuse my mistaking this business so much;&mdash;the paltry Frisieur
never enter'd my head;&mdash;you recollect I gave him a little flagellation
this morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Yes, and I recollect the occasion too;&mdash;this confounded
upstart Constitution (that cause of all my crosses and
troubles) is at the bottom of every mischief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> Yes, your wou'd-be Constitution, has indeed done
a deal of mischief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I deny it;&mdash;it is perfectly inoffensive and mild.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> Mild, indeed:&mdash;happy would it be for America, if
her government was more coercive and energetic!&mdash;I suppose
you have heard that Massachusetts has ratified this upstart
Constitution;&mdash;this is the sixth grand column in the federal edi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[Pg 401]</a></span>fice;
we only want three more to make up the lucky nine; and
then the nine Muses will make our western world their permanent
abode; and <i>he</i> who is at once their Favourite and Patron, will

arts will then flourish, and literature be properly encouraged.
That's the grand <i>desideratum</i> of <i>my</i> wishes.</p>

as you have but one side,&mdash;go on, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> I am happy I can so soon relieve you from it, sir.
Young Mr. Loveyet arrived this morning; but, it seems, the old
gentleman has entirely forgot him, during his long absence; and
when he heard his father's resolution, in consequence of the dispute
he had with you, he did not think proper to make himself
known. It was this which made him think me so culpable, that
you hear he talks of marrying him to my friend Maria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> I see into the mistake; but the worst construction
the affair will admit, does not justify his using you so indecently;
and, if it were not for the more powerful consideration of a
daughter's happiness, I would make him repent it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> I have ever found my honoured, my only parent
both wise in concerting plans for that daughter's happiness, and
good in executing them to the utmost of his ability; and, I dare
say, he does not think her alliance with Mr. Loveyet's son will
prove unfavourable to her happiness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trueman.</span> Far from it, my child:&mdash;Your unusual good sense
makes a common-place lecture unnecessary, Harriet; but beware
of flattery and dissimulation; for the manners of the present age
are so dissolute, that the young fellows of these degenerate days
think they cannot be fine gentlemen without being rakes, and&mdash;in
short, rascals; for they make a merit even of debauching innocence:&mdash;indeed,
that is scarcely to be wondered at, when so many
of those who are called ladies of taste and fashion, strange as it
may seem, like them the better for it;&mdash;but I hope, you and Mr.
Loveyet are exceptions to such depravity.</p>

<p class="befstagedir"><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Here's that mackmarony again.</p>
<p class="stagedir">[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> I have not the honour to know your name, sir,
but if you will inform me what you were whispering with Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[Pg 405]</a></span>
Loveyet about, you will make me the most obsequious and devoted
of your slaves.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> My slave!&mdash;Why, I wou'dn't have you for a slave,
if you was to pay me for it;&mdash;with your silk sattin breeches, and
your lily white gloves, and your crimp'd up toes, and your fine
powder'd calabash, that's so smart outside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> You entirely mistake my meaning, friend;&mdash;I'm
a man of quality.&mdash;Do I look like a servant, a hireling, a vile
menial?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> No, you look more like a dancing-master, a fighting-master,
or a play-actor, or some such flashy folks; but looks
is nothing, for everybody dresses alike nowadays; like master,
like man, as the old saying is; ecod, you can't tell a Congressman
from a marchant's 'prentice, everybody dresses so fine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> Ha, ha, ha,&mdash;he is pasitively a very eccentric
bady, and there is a small tincture of a barbarous sart of wit in
what he says; but it wants an immensity of correction, an infinitude
of polishing; he is a mere son of nature, everything he says
is express'd in such a Gathic, uncouth, Anti-Chesterfieldian style;
and as for his dress, it is pasitively most prepasterously clownish
and original.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Why he talks as many long-winded, old-fashioned
words, as the Schoolmaster.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Pray what is your proper name,
besides Humphry? Your sirname, I mean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> My proper sirname is Humphry Cubb; why our
family is the most largest family within the circumroundibus of
fifty miles, and the most grandest too, tho' I say it that shou'dn't
say it; for my father's father's great-grandfather was a just-ass
of the peace, when King George the third was a sucking baby,
and, therefore, as father says, a greater <i>man</i> then, than he was,
ha, ha, ha. And his great aunt, by his mother's side, had the
honour to be chief waiting woman to Mynheer Van Hardsprakencrampdejawmetlongname,
the Dutch governor's public scratchetary;
but I needn't go so far back neither, for I've got, at this
present time, no less than two second cousins; one of 'em is
soup-provider for the county, and t'other belongs to the liglislature,
and both belonging to our family too;&mdash;both Cubbs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> Yes, the world abounds with Cubbs, just
such unlick'd ones as you are;&mdash;there is a profusion of them in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[Pg 406]</a></span>
this city.&mdash;You must know, <i>I</i> am Dick Worthnought, esquire;
a gentleman, a buck of the blood, and a&mdash;you understand me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Why, your family must be as big as mine, then;
for I've seen hundreds of such Worth-nothing bloody bucks as
you, since I've been in town.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> Your criticisms are perfectly barbarous and
disagreeable, 'foregad; but,&mdash;will you let me know what you and
the West-India young gentleman were whispering about, at Miss
Trueman's?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Yes.&mdash;You can have Miss Trueman now, if you've
a mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> Can I? Only prove your words, and enroll
me your everlasting, your indissoluble friend, demme.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Friend me none of your friends; I don't want such
everlasting friends as you, d'ye see, becase why, if you never
make a beginning with your friendship, I'm sure it can't be everlasting;
and if you've got a mind to shew your friendliness, I'm
sure you cou'dn't have a more fitter time than now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> What wou'd the addity have me say, I
wonder.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> I wou'dn't have you say anything,&mdash;you talk too
much already, for the matter o' that; I like for to see people do
things, not talk 'em.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> There [<i>Gives him money.</i>]&mdash;is that what you
want?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Aye, I thought you understood me well enough.&mdash;Your
friendship wants as much spurring and kicking and coaxing
as our lazy old gelding at home;&mdash;I wou'dn't trust such a friend
as far as I cou'd fling a cow by the tail.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> Poh, poh,&mdash;to the point, to the point.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Why, then you must know, how old Mr. Lovit is a
going for to marry the West-Indian young gentleman to young
Mistress Airy, I think he call'd her; and so you can go try Mistress
Harriet yourself, for I'm sure she won't have him now.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> Why, pray?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> Why if she gets him, she'll get a bastard, for old
Mr. Lovit isn't his father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> No?</p>

<p class="befstagedir"><span class="smcap">Humphry.</span> No;&mdash;and then he and the Schoolmaster kick'd
up a proper rumpus about a challenge I fetch'd him; and that's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[Pg 407]</a></span>
all the news you'll get for your money.&mdash;A poor shilling that
won't buy ale to my oysters to-night.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Worthnought</span> [<i>manet</i>].</p>

<p class="befstagedir">This is a lucky meeting, 'foregad;&mdash;I'll go immediately and
report, that young Loveyet has of late seen my quondam charmer
carry a copy of him in miniature about her, which (strange to
tell) is continually growing nearer to the life; and that he refuses
to have her, on that account.&mdash;"If she gets him, she will get a
bastard."&mdash;By which I choose to understand,&mdash;matters have gone
so far, that she cannot save herself from that disgrace, even if she
marries him.&mdash;Now, in order that this tale of mine may transpire
briskly, I must first see some of my tattling female friends;&mdash;they
will set it a going like wild-fire.&mdash;Split me, but it is an excellent
thought;&mdash;ha, ha, ha. Poor Loveyet.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Cantwell</span> and <span class="smcap">Herald</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantwell.</span> I am very happy to find you home;&mdash;I was almost
eat up with the vapours before I saw you. [<i>Sighs.</i>]&mdash;Well, what's
the news, Miss Herald?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herald.</span> Nothing strange, Miss Tabitha; I am as barren of
anything new, as an old Almanack.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantwell.</span> Oh shocking!&mdash;"as barren of anything new."&mdash;What
an odious expression!&mdash;The most vulgarest comparison in
nature.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herald.</span> Umph.&mdash;I suppose, if Mr. Gracely was here, you
would not be so much in the dumps.</p>

<p class="befstagedir"><span class="smcap">Cantwell.</span> Ah, Miss Herald!&mdash;If you felt the corruptions of
your wicked heart, you would be in the dumps too, as you call it.</p>

<p class="stagedir">[<i>Sighs.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herald.</span> I believe there is a certain corruption in your heart,
which our sex are apt to feel very sensibly, and that is the want
of a husband.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantwell.</span> The want of a husband!&mdash;I vow, you are monstrous
indelicate, Miss Herald; I am afraid you are wandering
from the paths of vartue, as dear good Mr. Gracely says.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herald.</span> There comes his very reverse,&mdash;Mr. Worthnought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantwell.</span> Ah, he is a profane rake; he is lighter than vanity,
as Mr. Gracely says;&mdash;a mere painted sepulchre.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[Pg 408]</a></span></p>

<p class="befstagedir"><span class="smcap">Herald.</span> That ancient sepulchre of yours is pretty much daub'd, I think.</p>
<p class="stagedir">[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter <span class="smcap">Worthnought</span>.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> Ladies, <i>J'ay bien de la joye de vous voir.</i> I
have the supernal and superlative hanor and felicity, of being
most respectfully yours.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantwell.</span> I hope I have the pleasure to see Mr. Worthnought
well.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> <i>L&agrave;, L&agrave;, Mademoiselle; assez bien: Je vous
suis oblig&eacute;.</i>&mdash;She has reviv'd her wither'd chaps with rouge in a
very nasty manner, 'pan hanor. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Have you heard the
news, respecting Miss Harriet Trueman, ladies?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantwell.</span> Yes, now I think on 't, there is a report about
town, that old Mr. Loveyet saw her and another rather familiar
together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> Oh, you have not heard half, madam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantwell.</span> Do, let us hear, Mr. Worthnought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herald.</span> Aye, do; but do not say anything that will hurt Miss
Tabitha's delicacy; for, before you came in, I was complaining
that I was <i>barren</i> of anything new, and she was almost ready to
swoon at the expression.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> If Miss Tabitha has such an antipathy to
barrenness, she will not be offended at my subject, which is a
very prolific one, I assure you; for Miss Trueman is on the verge
of <i>bearing</i> a son.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantwell.</span> Oh, horrid! What will this wicked world come to
at last!&mdash;A good-for-nothing, wanton hussy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> Very true, madam:&mdash;by persons of easy notions
of virtue, indeed, it would be considered a trifling <i>faux pas</i>,
as the French call it; a perfect <i>bagatelle</i>; or, at most, a superficial
act of incontinency; but to those who have such rigid notions of
virtue as Miss Cantwell, for example, or Miss Herald, or their
humble servant; it appears quite another thing, quite another
thing, ladies:&mdash;though it is one of my foibles;&mdash;I own it is a fault
to be so intalerably nice about the affairs of women; but it is a
laudable imperfection, if I may be allowed the phrase;&mdash;it is erring
on the safe side, for women's affairs are delicate things to
meddle with, ladies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantwell.</span> You are perfectly in the right, Mr. Worthnought,
but one can't help speaking up for the honour of one's sex, you
know.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[Pg 409]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> Very true, madam:&mdash;to make the matter still
worse, ladies, Mr. Loveyet is just arrived from abroad to be
married to her; and the old gentleman is going to ally him immediately
to Miss Maria Airy in consequence of it.</p>

<p class="befstagedir"><span class="smcap">Herald.</span> I am glad of that, however;&mdash;I will forgive Miss Trueman her
failing, if that is the case, for then I shall have a better chance to gain Frankton.</p>
<p class="stagedir">[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p class="befstagedir"><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> But this is <i>entre nous</i>, ladies.&mdash;[<i>Looks at his watch.</i>]
Hah,&mdash;the <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te!</i>&mdash;Ladies, I have the hanor to be your slave.</p>
<p class="stagedir">[<i>Going.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cantwell.</span> You are positively the greatest lady's man, Mr.
Worthnought,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> I am proud of your compliment, madam; and
I wish Miss Tabitha could consider me such, from her own experience;
it would be conferring the highest hanor on her slave, 'pan
hanor.</p>

<p class="befstagedir"><span class="smcap">Cantwell.</span> Oh, sir,&mdash;your politeness quite confuses me.</p>
<p class="stagedir">[<i>Curtsying.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Worthnought.</span> Miss Herald, your thrice devoted.&mdash;<i>Mademoiselle,
je suis votre Serviteur tr&egrave;s humble.</i></p>

you think he is a very pretty fellow, Miss
Herald?&mdash;He's the very pattern of true politeness; his address is
so winning and agreeable,&mdash;and then, he talks French, with the
greatest felicity imaginable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Herald.</span> I cannot say I see many perfections in him; but you
talk'd very differently just now;&mdash;Mr. Worthnought then was
lighter than vanity; and now, it seems, he has more weight with
you, than good Mr. Gracely.</p>

<p class="befstagedir"><span class="smcap">Cantwell.</span> You are only mortify'd that Mr. Worthnought
took so little notice of you, ma'am; you see he prefers me to you,
though you value yourself so much upon being a little young,
ma'am; you see men of sense don't mind a few years, ma'am;
so your servant, ma'am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> How!&mdash;Was you not with Harriet Trueman, this

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> Yes, sir; but I have no intention to supplant your
son, I assure you; on the contrary, it is the supreme wish of my
heart, that his love may be rewarded with so rich a treasure as the
amiable Harriet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> He shall be rewarded with a much richer one, if he
is wise enough to think so.</p>

to my marrying Miss Trueman, sir.</p>

not you this minute say, you did not intend to have her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> I did not, sir; I mean to have her if possible, and
that without disappointing your son; but I shall explain myself
better, by telling you who I am. Look at me well, sir&mdash;did you

and I'm very much mistaken, if&mdash;yes, that reconciles all his

you;&mdash;you did take your father in a little, to be sure; but never
mind it;&mdash;I'll take you in another way, perhaps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charles.</span> I wish you would take me in the matrimonial way,
sir;&mdash;that would be a most agreeable take in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Well, well, we shall not disagree about that:&mdash;I am
very happy this affair clears up Harriet's conduct so well; she is
a fine girl, that's certain; and, if you love her as much as you formerly
did, why&mdash;I don't know what I may not do.</p>

my Love is to be the condition of the welcome Bond, I do not care
if it is executed to-morrow; for, were the penalty an age of love,
I am sure I could pay it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> By my body, I'll have a wedding soon, and a merry
one too:&mdash;I'll go and make it up with old Trueman;&mdash;but then he

of the new Constitution.</p>

corrupted, aristocratic profligate!&mdash;But you shall not have her

fall prostrate in the dust!&mdash;Do, sir, try and think better of the

father, and lose my Harriet.</p>

about such matters, at your time of life.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the arrival of Charles, and the happy

says he is married to Maria; another says, he is discovered to be
illegitimate; a third reports, he was found in company with a

a fourth says, that old Mr. Loveyet is going to disinherit him, in

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> You seem unusually serious, Miss Harriet: I
hope Mr. Trueman has not proved relentless as you expected.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> No sir; it gives me pleasure to acquaint you, my
father was all kindness and forgiveness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I wish I could say so of mine;&mdash;he indeed was kind
and forgiving too at first; but no sooner had I begun to anticipate
approaching happiness, than one luckless circumstance deprived
me of all that love and hope had inspired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> An unlucky circumstance, indeed; but would the
disappointment really be so great, if you were obliged to give up
the thought of an alliance with me?</p>

<p class="befstagedir"><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> How, Miss Harriet! Give up the thought of having you!&mdash;By
heaven, it must be so!&mdash;Yes, the beau would never have presumed to say
so much if it were not so;&mdash;and Frankton's ambiguous account of them
both, confirms the suspicion;&mdash;and then the extravagant encomiums he
bestowed on her yesterday.&mdash;Confusion! my fears were just, though he
ridicul'd me for exposing them.&mdash;But she must not see my anxiety.</p>
<p class="stagedir">[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> If my doubts are well founded, he must be an adept
in the art of dissimulation. I will try him a little farther.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
What think you, Mr. Loveyet, of our New-York
beauties? Have not the superior charms of so many fine women,
been able to overcome such old-fashioned notions as constancy
and priority of affection?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I have beheld their beauty with equal pleasure and
astonishment; and the understanding, the affability, and vivacity,
by which strangers, with so much propriety, characterize my
fair countrywomen, give them a pre-eminence over the ladies of
most other countries, that is highly gratifying to a mind already
so much attached to its native city, by the most endearing of all
human ties;&mdash;they are all that the warmest, the most luxuriant
fancy can wish; beautiful&mdash;almost beyond the possibility of an
increase of charms; and&mdash;I had almost said, they furnish room
for love and warm conceptions, "even to madness!"</p>

<p class="befstagedir"><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> I am in doubt no longer;&mdash;such passionate expressions must have
Love for their prompter.</p>
<p class="stagedir">[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> My friend Frankton extolled them highly; but his
description derogates from their desert;&mdash;you, too, he praised;&mdash;I
listened to him&mdash;with unspeakable delight, and believed him
with all the ardour of faith and expectation; for I could readily believe
that, which I had so often, so sweetly experienced;&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[Pg 415]</a></span>
when you last blest my eyes with that enchanting form, how was
the idea exceeded by the reality!&mdash;To do justice to <i>such</i> perfection,
the praises I this minute bestowed on the ladies I have seen,
would be spiritless and insufficient!&mdash;To charms like Miss Harriet's,
what hermit could remain insensible!&mdash;<i>I</i> was not insensible;&mdash;the
tender passion, I began so early to entertain; a passion,
which length of absence, and a succession of objects and events,
had rendered too dormant, was then excited to sensations the
most exquisitely sensible;&mdash;was then taught to glow with a
flame, too fervent to be now suppressed!</p>

<p class="befstagedir"><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Were I but sure of his sincerity!</p>
<p class="stagedir">[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> With what indifference she hears me!&mdash;If she is
so insensible to the genuine effusions of a heart like mine, I am
lost indeed! But I will try a little deception to discover the truth.
[<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;What a lovely picture Mr. Frankton drew of Miss
Airy! But it was not too highly finished; for a thousand Loves
and Graces have conspired, to make her the most accomplished
of her sex.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> My pride shall not let him triumph over my chagrin.
[<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;I know Miss Airy to be as accomplished as you
represent her, sir: and Mr. Frankton gave such a lovely description
of her, you say;&mdash;I dare say he did;&mdash;oh,&mdash;yes&mdash;yes [<i>Appears
disconcerted, by striving to hide her concern.</i>]&mdash;he loves her to
distraction;&mdash;Mr. Frankton has doubtless made a wise choice.</p>

<p class="befstagedir"><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> By all that's false, she is concerned at Frankton's having
praised his mistress! She absolutely loves him!</p>
<p class="stagedir">[<i>Aside.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> And you have seen the amiable Miss Airy, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Forgive me, honour and veracity. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Yes,
Miss Trueman; and not without a deep sense of her uncommon
worth and beauty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> I admire your discernment, sir;&mdash;Mr. Frankton,
too, is a very nice judge of female merit; and he cannot evince his
judgment better, than by praising my friend Maria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Pardon me, madam: with submission to your
friend's merit, I think his panegyric would better apply to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> That compliment is too great, to be meant, I fancy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I rather think, you value the author of it so little,
that you would as soon he should withhold it, madam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Certainly, sir, when I have reason to think there is
another who has a better right to it, and for whom it is secretly
intended.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[Pg 416]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> You wrong me much, madam:&mdash;some tattling gossip
or designing knave, has whispered some falsehood to my prejudice;&mdash;probably
my <i>rival</i>,&mdash;Mr. Worthnought.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> If you have come here with a design to use me ill,
sir, I beg you will tell me so, and then I shall act accordingly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Your actions accord very illy with your <i>professions</i>,
I think, madam.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> <i>Your</i> duplicity, sir, both in word and action, justifies
my retorting that ungenerous accusation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> I entreat you to believe me, Miss Harriet, when I
say, I am unconscious of having done anything I ought to be
ashamed of, since my arrival: I am so confident of this, that the
circulation of a malicious rumour, however dishonourable to me,
would give me little disquiet, did I not reflect, that it is the object
of Harriet's credulity;&mdash;a reflection, that is the source of real unhappiness
to me:&mdash;be kind then, Harriet, and tell me wherein I
am guilty;&mdash;obscurity in a matter so interesting, gives more torture
to the mind, than the most unwelcome truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> He must be sincere. [<i>Aside.</i>]&mdash;Your request shall
be comply'd with, sir.&mdash;The principal offence you are charged
with, is your having been smitten by the lady, on whom you have
bestowed such liberal commendation;&mdash;be that as it may, I
heard Mr. Loveyet talk of such a match:&mdash;I believe it will require
a more able advocate than yourself, to defend <i>this</i> cause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Suppose I assure you, on the sacred honour of a gentleman,
that what you have heard is false;&mdash;suppose I add the
more important sanction of an oath, to seal the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> I will save you that trouble:&mdash;you have an advocate
<i>here</i>, which has already gained your cause.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Oh, Harriet, you are too good!&mdash;Conscious as I am
of the rectitude of my conduct, as it respects my Harriet;&mdash;sure
as I am of not deserving your displeasure, I still feel myself unworthy
of such matchless goodness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> You say too much; and compel me to tell you that
you merit my highest esteem.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Esteem! What a cold epithet!&mdash;And am not I
entitled to something more than <i>esteem</i>?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> Excuse the poverty of the expression; and be assured,
my heart dictated a more exalted word;&mdash;let this confession
atone for the fault.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[Pg 417]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> And yet I would fain attract your esteem too; for,
I have heard connoisseurs in the science of Love say, it is possible
to <i>love</i> an object, and that to distraction, without having a particle
of <i>esteem</i> for it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> I have assured you that <i>my</i> esteem is at least
equalled by a more passionate affection:&mdash;but how strangely you
talk!&mdash;First you acknowledge yourself unworthy of my favour;&mdash;then
you are alarmed that I should only esteem you; and when I
talk of a passion, superior to mere <i>Platonic</i> love, you are afraid,
on the other hand, it is a blind, enthusiastic impulse, not founded
on <i>esteem</i>.&mdash;How inconsistent are lovers!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Your reasoning, like your person, surprises, charms
and subdues:&mdash;I will be more consistent;&mdash;but our contention is
only for pre-eminence in love;&mdash;delightful emulation! Agreeable
inconsistency!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> I am now ashamed of my childish suspicions; but I
should not have been so credulous, had it not been for an affection,
which rendered my better judgment blind to the fallacy, and
made me more apprehensive of your inconstancy, than satisfied
of your innocence; and this disposed me to misinterpret every
thing you said.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> And your apparent indifference, in consequence
of that misinterpretation, excited similar suspicions in me; and
thus, mutual distrust produced mutual misapprehension.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> But you have not told me the particulars of your
interview with old Mr. Loveyet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> Were you to hear those particulars, they would only
afford you pain;&mdash;'tis sufficient for me to tell you, he has turned
me out of his house, only because I told him, I was a friend to the
new Constitution, forsooth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> He is a strange character:&mdash;when I call'd on my
father, I was alarmed to find them at high words;&mdash;and he
abus'd <i>me</i> most unmercifully.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Loveyet.</span> He did? 'Tis well for him he has call'd himself my
father;&mdash;but if my Harriet consents, I will immediately put myself
in a situation that will justify my preventing his future ill
usage:&mdash;Fortune has enabled me to act independent either of his
frown or his favour;&mdash;I have taken such measures, in consequence
of his base usage, as will guard us against the effects of the one,
without obliging us to cringe for the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">[Pg 418]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harriet.</span> I am happy to hear it; but affluence is not my object,
nor poverty my dread; and I am happy I can convince you
how little I desire an alliance for interest, by now tendering you
the whole of my trifling fortune, in case your father should deprive
you of yours.</p>
